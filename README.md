# Forgero example extension pack

This is an example extension pack for the [Forgero project](https://github.com/SigmundGranaas/forgero), a Minecraft mod made for Fabric.

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.

1. Update the `fabric.mod.json` file to have your own attributes, like sources, contact, authors, contributors, Discord, etc
2. Make sure to rename the main `net.fabricmc` packages to your own domain like `io.github.yourgithubusername`, and rename the `ExampleMod` class, as well as the entrypoints (in `fabric.mod.json`)
3. Plop a custom icon into `/src/main/resources/assets/modid/icon.png`

You're good to go! Enjoy, and good luck, making a Forgero extension pack!
